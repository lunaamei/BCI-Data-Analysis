# BCI-Data-Analysis

The goal of this group work was to get familiar with real EEG data and perform Time Series Analysis. The dataset was found via Open Access on Physionet (https://physionet.org/content/erpbci/1.0.0/)


ERP-based Brain-Computer Interface recordings (March 4, 2014, 6:30 p.m.)

This dataset, created and contributed by Luca Citi, Riccardo Poli, and Caterina Cinel, was generated as part of a study aimed at identifying the factors limiting the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on event-related potentials (ERPs), in order to improve the transfer rate and the usability of these interfaces. Twenty recordings of each of 10 participants include annotated 64-channel EEGs and 4-channel EOGs, generated while the participants focused on specified target characters displayed by a traditional matrix speller.
